My hometown is <a href = " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jining" class = "a1">Jining, Shandong province</a>, which is a fantastic city with trees and flowers. As a hard-working student,
I was always the top student in my middle school and high school. Also, I am lucky that I can study in <a href = "https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn" class = "a1">XJTLU</a>, 
which is an energetic college and full of young adults.
</p>
<p class = "p1">
As for working experience, 
I volunteered to teach math in a remote mountain village in Yunnan province last year and I finished my internship in our 
university library. This September I will go to <a href = "https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/" class = "a1">Liverpool university</a> to gain more knowledge and I hope 
this will be an interesting experience. I do not have a girlfriend but I enjoy my life, that is enough. 
Finally, I hope my future will be brighter and brighter on account of my hard work.
